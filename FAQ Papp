The program does not work. It says something is missing.

-> Papp runs as a Linux emulation. The "cygwin1.dll" library
is necessary. You can find it in the same directory you downloaded
Papp from (especially on the FFO web site : http://www.ffothello.org)
The library must be put in your WINDOWS directory of your hard disk.
Beware to have a recent library. The library on the web site will always be
up to date with papp. If the program says something is not the library,
that is probably because you have an old version.
Cygwin1.dll is the Linux emulation library; it is part of the Cygwin project.
More information can be found on http://www.cygwin.com


The console window is too small, I can't see a thing

-> Under W2K and XP, the console-window can be resized by using
the properties item in the window menu. Change rows (48 is nice)
and columns (80 is the minimum); don't forget to save changes for
all future windows with the same name.


I can't read French!

-> Papp exists also in English. Just look for "papp_xxx_en"
on the server. Unfortunately, documentation is only in French
for the moment.
