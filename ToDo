- Put papp on GitHub and write a readme file.

- Translate documentation

- Refactor code to have everything in English (source files, config files, documentation).

- Change makefile to create all versions for all platforms.

- Add a FIX_SEED option which garanties same random sequence for each launch, therefore enabling tests.

- Add a scripting feature to papp so that instead of using a menu, papp can run a complete tournament from a file. This will enable us to design tests.

- Add a transactional feature where the program is launched with a single command and exits.

- Add the possibility to run several tournaments together

- Add a GUI.



Below are some previous todo. 

* Improve round-robin implementation. Ideally, we would want papp to look at the first (n-1) rounds and decide whether they can come from a round-robin. If so, deduce round n pairings or fallback on the normal algorithm.

* In a partial pairing, it would probably be more interesting to have the full pairing penalty (and not only penalty for the remaining ones).

* And also to know what is the penalty offset induced by the imposed pairings (ie: how much is the overall penalty increased by the imposed pairings compared to an optimal pairing).

* For the Windows version, clean up tmp files which have been left by previous killed papps and/or use temp directoru for temp files rather then current dir (this should be used if opening of standard tmp directory fails).

* Have an automatic retrieval of players and config files from a server.
